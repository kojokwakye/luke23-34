*[this](https://kojokwakye.github.io/luke23-34/)* only exists because i don't like keeping alot of things in my bookmark tab

- dont ask me why i didn't create a folder in my bookmarks. i wouldn't have an answer for you

- i don't own *[this](https://proxybay.github.io/)*.  
it is bascially a poxy site for *pirate bay* that allows you to pybass blocks.  

- i can share every link in one time
